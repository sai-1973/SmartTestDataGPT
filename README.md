🧠 Smart Test Data Generator using ChatGPT
A modern, AI-powered test data generation tool that creates contextual, persona-based, and scenario-driven synthetic data — ideal for developers, testers, and researchers.
> Built for the new generation of software testing and open-source innovation.

🚀 Features
* 🎯 Persona-based user profile generation (e.g. "35-year-old doctor from Mumbai who shops online weekly")
* 💬 Dynamic customer feedback simulation (positive, negative, or neutral tone)
* 📊 Output formats: JSON, CSV, SQL
* 🧩 Easy integration via REST API or CLI
* 🛠️ Built for extensibility and open-source contribution

🔍 Why This Project?
Traditional tools like Faker, Mockaroo, and DataSynthesizer generate structured but shallow data. Our project uses ChatGPT to introduce rich context, diversity, emotion, and user behavior for:
* Realistic testing environments
* Privacy-compliant synthetic datasets
* Better QA, demos, and machine learning testing
